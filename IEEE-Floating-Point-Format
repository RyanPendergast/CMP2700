Express the following numbers in IEEE 32-bit floating-point format: -5

Step 1: Convert -5 to binary.

Since -5 is negative, we will first represent its absolute value in binary, then take the two's complement to represent it as a negative number.

5 in binary is 101, so the absolute value of -5 in binary is 11111011.

Step 2: Determine the sign bit.

Since -5 is negative, the sign bit is 1.

Step 3: Normalize the binary number.

To normalize the binary number, we need to shift the binary point to the left until there is a single 1 to the left of the binary point.

11111011 can be normalized as follows: 1.1111011 x 2^2

Step 4: Determine the exponent.

The exponent is the power of 2 by which the binary point was shifted during normalization. In this case, the binary point was shifted 2 positions to the left, so the exponent is 2.

Step 5: Convert the exponent to binary.

The exponent in binary is 2 + 127 = 129 in decimal.

129 in binary is 10000001.

Step 6: Combine the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa.

The 32-bit IEEE floating-point format has 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23 mantissa bits.

The sign bit is 1, the exponent in binary is 10000001, and the mantissa is the binary digits to the right of the binary point in the normalized binary number (1.1111011), which is 11110110000000000000000.

So the IEEE 32-bit floating-point representation of -5 is:

1 10000001 11110110000000000000000
