The follwoing numbers use the IEEE 32-bit floating-point format. What is the 
equivalent decimal value?
0 01111110 10100000000000000000000

The sign bit is 0, which means the number is positive.
The exponent is 01111110, which is 126 in decimal after subtracting the bias of 127.
The mantissa is 10100000000000000000000 in binary.
To calculate the decimal value of this number, we first need to convert the mantissa to decimal by summing the values of each bit position, where each bit position represents a negative power of 2. The first bit to the right of the binary point has a value of 1/2, the second bit has a value of 1/4, the third bit has a value of 1/8, and so on.

In this case, the binary mantissa is 10100000000000000000000, which gives us:

1/2 + 1/16 = 0.5625

Next, we need to use the exponent to scale this value. Since the exponent is positive, we multiply the mantissa by 2^(exponent - bias), where the bias is 127 for single-precision floating-point numbers.

2^(126 - 127) = 2^(-1) = 1/2

So the decimal value of this number is:

0.5625 x 1/2 = 0.28125

Therefore, the equivalent decimal value of 0 01111110 10100000000000000000000 is 0.28125.

0 10000000 00000000000000000000000

The sign bit is 1, which means the number is negative.
The exponent is 10000000, which is 128 in decimal after subtracting the bias of 127.
The mantissa is 00000000000000000000000 in binary

However, there is a special case in the IEEE 754 standard where an exponent of all 1's and a
mantissa of all 0's represents either positive or negative infinity, depending on the sign bit.
In this case, the exponent is 10000000, which is all 1's, and the mantissa is all 0's. Therefore,
the number represented by 0 10000000 00000000000000000000000 is negative infinity.

So the equivalent decimal value of 0 10000000 00000000000000000000000 is negative infinity.
