(AD)Hex: This is a hexadecimal number, which means it uses the base-16 number system. Hexadecimal numbers use 16 distinct symbols,
usually the numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F. In this case, the number is AD.

(?)2: This is asking for the conversion of the hexadecimal number into a binary number, which uses the base-2 number system. Binary 
numbers only use two symbols, usually 0 and 1.

(?)10: This is asking for the conversion of the hexadecimal number into a decimal number, which uses the base-10 number system. 
Decimal numbers use 10 distinct symbols, the numbers 0-9.

To convert from hexadecimal to binary, we can use the following steps:

Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.
Group the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the right-hand side of the number.
If necessary, add leading zeros to the left-hand side of the number to make the groups of four digits.
Let's apply these steps to (AD)Hex:
A = 1010
D = 1101

So, (AD)Hex in binary is:
1010 1101

To convert from hexadecimal to decimal, we can use the following steps:

Write down the hexadecimal number.
Multiply each digit of the number by 16 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 on the right-hand side.
Add the products from step 2 together to get the decimal equivalent.
Let's apply these steps to (AD)Hex:
A = 10
D = 13

So, (AD)Hex in decimal is:
10 * 16^1 + 13 * 16^0 = 173

Therefore, (AD)Hex = (10101101)2 = (173)10.
