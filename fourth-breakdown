(334.2301)10       =  ( ? )2

Converting a decimal number to binary involves two steps. The integer part and the fractional part of the number need to be converted separately.

For the integer part, we repeatedly divide by 2 and keep track of the remainders until the quotient becomes zero. Then we write the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.

For the fractional part, we repeatedly multiply by 2 and write down the integer part of the result. We keep doing this until the fractional part becomes zero, or until we reach a desired level of precision.

So, let's apply this method to the given decimal number:

Integer part:

334 / 2 = 167, remainder = 0
167 / 2 = 83, remainder = 1
83 / 2 = 41, remainder = 1
41 / 2 = 20, remainder = 1
20 / 2 = 10, remainder = 0
10 / 2 = 5, remainder = 0
5 / 2 = 2, remainder = 1
2 / 2 = 1, remainder = 0
1 / 2 = 0, remainder = 1

The remainders in reverse order are 101001110. This is the binary representation of the integer part.

Fractional part:

0.2301 * 2 = 0.4602 -> 0
0.4602 * 2 = 0.9204 -> 0
0.9204 * 2 = 1.8408 -> 1
0.8408 * 2 = 1.6816 -> 1
0.6816 * 2 = 1.3632 -> 1
0.3632 * 2 = 0.7264 -> 0
0.7264 * 2 = 1.4528 -> 1
0.4528 * 2 = 0.9056 -> 0

The integer part of each multiplication is written in order to obtain the binary representation of the fractional part, which is 00111010.

Putting the two parts together, we get:

(334.2301)10 = (101001110.00111010)2
