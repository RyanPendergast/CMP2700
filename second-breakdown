(24)7     = (  ? )10    = ( ? )2 

The number (24)7 means that the number 24 is written in base 7. To convert this to base 10 (decimal), we need to evaluate
the value of the number in powers of 7. We start with the rightmost digit, which represents the units place, and then work our way to the left.

To convert (24)7 to base 10, we can use the following formula:

(24)7 = 27^1 + 47^0

Here, the rightmost digit "4" is multiplied by 7^0 (which is 1), giving us 4. The digit to the left of that, "2", is multiplied by 7^1 (which is 7), 
giving us 14. Adding these two values together, we get:

(24)7 = 27^1 + 47^0 = 14 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the number (24)7 is equivalent to the decimal number 18.

To convert this decimal number to binary (base 2), we can use a similar process of successive division by 2. Here are the steps:

Divide 18 by 2. The quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0.
Divide 9 by 2. The quotient is 4 and the remainder is 1.
Divide 4 by 2. The quotient is 2 and the remainder is 0.
Divide 2 by 2. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 0.
Divide 1 by 2. The quotient is 0 and the remainder is 1.
Now, we read off the remainders from the bottom to the top to get the binary representation:

18 = (10010)2

Therefore, (24)7 is equivalent to (10010)2 in binary.
